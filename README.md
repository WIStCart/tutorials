## [Download Imagery and Lidar from the WisconsinView Data Archive with Python](https://github.com/WIStCart/tutorials/tree/WisconsinView)

[](https://github.com/WIStCart/tutorials/tree/historic-aerial-imagery)The WisconsinView Data Archive (WDA) is a repository of Wisconsin aerial imagery and lidar-derived elevation data products.  The primary search interface for the WDA is the [GeoData@Wisconsin](https://geodata.wisc.edu) geportal.  Some users may also wish to use a desktop client such as Cyberduck or FileZilla Pro for ["bulk downloads" of data](https://geodata.wisc.edu/pages/lidar-imagery).  

In situations where it is not possible or desirable to use one of those access methods, it is also possible to use a Python script to grab data from the archive.  This tutorial is for more advanced users who are comfortable with Python 3.x.



## [Using ArcGIS Pro and Python to Download Wisconsin Historic Aerial Imagery](https://github.com/WIStCart/tutorials/tree/historic-aerial-imagery)

Robinson Map Library (RML) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison maintains an extensive digital archive of historic Wisconsin aerial photography dating from 1936 to the present.  This is in addition to a physical archive of nearly 260,00 print photographs.

This tutorial is aimed at intermediate GIS users who would like to download aerial imagery from the RML archive using a scripted approach.  Specifically,  a combination of ArcGIS Pro, a feature service stored in ArcGIS Online, and Python. The tutorial assumes a working knowledge of ArcGIS Pro 3.x and Python 3.x.






## [Making a Web Map with Leaflet in One Minute](https://github.com/WIStCart/tutorials/tree/leaflet-one-minute-map)
[![Preview](https://github.com/WIStCart/tutorials/raw/leaflet-one-minute-map/meta/preview.png)](https://github.com/WIStCart/tutorials/tree/leaflet-one-minute-map)

The first part in a there part video presentation called *Making a webmap in 1 minute, 1 hour, and 10 hours*. In this part we create a web map using Leaflet in "one minute". This is a bit misleading as preparing the data, making decisions on styling and whatnot takes more than a minute. However, it is not unreasonable to assume a lot of this code is shared between projects and therefore mostly comprised of template code chunks with minor customization. If you move through this tutorial quickly enough, it can be done in a minute.

Topics covered:
- Create blank map with basemap
- Add geojson data as points
- Color points based on category
- Click for photo in popup
